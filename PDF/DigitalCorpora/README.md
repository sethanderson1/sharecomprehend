Digital Corpora has a repo of 8 million PDFs scraped from the web in the summer of 2021.

PDFs in 0000-0999_ENGLISH folder were obtained from the 0000.zip file on here:

https://downloads.digitalcorpora.org/corpora/files/CC-MAIN-2021-31-PDF-UNTRUNCATED/zipfiles/0000-0999/

There were 1000 files in that zip but most were non-english, so I put them through a python script to detect language and filter out the non-english ones.
